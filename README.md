# Daylign

*(formerly LifeStack)*

A personal life dashboard that aligns your day — tasks, workouts, nutrition, weigh-ins, and schedule in one place, with optional AI logging and Apple Watch sync. Built with **vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — no framework, no build step, no bundler.**

Installable as a PWA, syncs across devices via Firebase, and works offline.

## For designers (start here for a design pass)

Everything visual lives in **one file: `style.css`** (~5,000 lines). There is no CSS framework, no Tailwind, no CSS-in-JS — just plain CSS with custom properties.

**The entire theme is driven by CSS variables** defined at `:root` in `style.css`. Change these and the whole app reskins:

| Token | Value | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg-primary` / `--bg-secondary` | `#0b0b10` / `#0f0f16` | Page + panel backgrounds (dark) |
| `--bg-card` / `--bg-hover` | `#14141d` / `#1e1e2a` | Card surface / hover |
| `--border` | `#232330` | Hairline borders |
| `--text-primary` / `--secondary` / `--muted` | `#f2f2f7` / `#a5a5bd` / `#73738c` | Text hierarchy |
| `--accent` / `--accent-hover` / `--accent-glow` | `#6d6af8` (indigo) | Primary brand color, buttons, active states |
| `--green` / `--yellow` / `--red` / `--blue` / `--purple` | status colors | Progress dots, deltas, alerts |
| `--radius` / `--radius-sm` | `16px` / `10px` | Corner rounding |
| `--font-display` / `--font-body` | Space Grotesk / Inter | Headings vs body |
| `--shadow`, `--sidebar-width` | — | Elevation + layout |

**Structure:** `index.html` holds all markup. Each screen is a `<div class="view" id="...View">` (dashboard, tasks, board, calendar, gym, diet, settings) toggled by `switchView()` in `js/app.js`. Content is grouped into `.card` blocks. The layout is a fixed left `.sidebar` + main content on desktop, collapsing to a top bar + bottom `.bottom-nav` on mobile (`@media (max-width: 900px)`).

**It's fully responsive and theme-token-driven, so most redesigns are CSS-only** — recolor by editing the `:root` tokens, restyle components by editing their classes, no JS required. To preview changes, see *Running locally* below and open the app in a browser (or resize to phone width / use device-emulation).

**Current aesthetic:** dark, indigo-accented, rounded cards, Space Grotesk display type, generous spacing, subtle glows and micro-animations.

## Features

### Dashboard
- Task stats (total, in progress, completed, overdue) with project filtering
- **Health strip** — today's calories, net calories (food minus training + walking burn), protein, water, steps, exercise minutes, sleep, and weight, each vs. goal
- **Weekly Report** — trailing-7-day averages for calories, protein, carbs, fat, training, water, resting HR, and sleep, plus a single prioritized focus for the week
- Weight-trend chart (7-day smoothed) vs. goal line
- Smart reminders (gym gaps, water, calories, protein, weigh-ins, habits) and a drag-and-drop daily schedule

### Tasks
- **Board** (Kanban, drag-and-drop, category folders) and **List** views
- Subtask checklists, priorities, due dates, projects with custom colors
- Auto-archive of tasks completed 2+ weeks ago

### Calendar
- Month/week views with US holidays, custom color-coded events, and task dots on due dates

### Gym
- Log exercises with sets/reps/weight; automatic bodyweight-exercise detection
- **Trend body weight** (7-day rolling average) as the headline, with pace-to-goal tracking and ETA
- **Targets & Coach** — MET-based (or Apple-Watch-measured) calorie burn vs. goal, and rule-based training recommendations
- **Progressive overload** — beat-last-time chip, PR badges, and calisthenics progression ladders
- **Consistency** — day streak, weekly count, and a 16-week GitHub-style heatmap
- Built-in rest timer

### Diet
- 200+ food database (incl. South Indian foods and fast-food chains) with live search (Open Food Facts + USDA fallback), custom foods, serving math, and meal grouping
- Macro goal tracker (calories, protein, carbs, fat) with net-calorie awareness and protein-aware overage advice
- Water tracker with quick-add buttons

### AI logging *(optional — needs your own Anthropic API key)*
- **Photo food logging** — snap a plate; Claude vision estimates each item's macros into an editable confirmation card
- **Voice / natural-language commands** — a floating mic (or typed input) lets you say things like *"log 40 oz water,"* *"add a task to pay rent tomorrow,"* *"I weighed 163,"* or *"three idli for breakfast"*; Claude parses it into actions, each with an Undo
- See `HEALTH-SYNC.md` and the *AI features* note below for setup

### Apple Health / Apple Watch
- An iPhone Shortcut writes steps, active energy, exercise minutes, resting HR, and sleep into a separate Firebase node the app reads; watch-measured active burn replaces the estimate everywhere. Full setup in **`HEALTH-SYNC.md`**.

## Tech stack

- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** — no framework, no build tooling
- **CSS custom properties** for theming (single `style.css`)
- **Firebase Realtime Database** for cross-device sync (`js/firebase-sync.js`)
- **PWA** — installable, `sw.js` service worker, offline-capable
- **Anthropic API** called directly from the browser for the AI features (photo + voice), using a device-local key
- Deployed on **GitHub Pages** (auto-deploys on push to `main`)

## Running locally

No install or build. Either open `index.html` directly, or serve it (recommended, so the service worker and relative paths behave):

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080 -c-1 .
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

To test on a phone, open `http://<your-computer-lan-ip>:8080` on the same Wi-Fi.

## Data & privacy

- App data (tasks, workouts, meals, weigh-ins, water, goals) syncs to **Firebase Realtime Database** and is cached in `localStorage` for offline use.
- Apple Health/Watch data lives in a **separate `external` Firebase node** the app only reads — app writes can never overwrite it.
- **AI features** send the photo or spoken text to the Anthropic API. The **API key is stored only in that browser's `localStorage`** (`tf_anthropic_key`) — never committed to the repo or synced to Firebase — so a public repo never exposes a billable key. AI features are entirely optional and dormant until a key is added.
